README for TSQUARE

TSQUARE requires the third-party library packages CGAL and boost for its operation.
Configuration of TSQUARE will check whether these libraries are installed and will
fail if the libraries are not found.

On a Mac OS X, both CGAL and boost can be installed by macports.

For those not using macports, the packages can be downloaded as follows:

CGAL:  www.cgal.org/download.html

boost:  www.boost.org/users/download/


Users should follow all installation instructions for these libraries and test that
they are working prior to attempting to install TSQUARE.

Also, as also described in the INSTALL file, the ./configure command for this build
should be:

LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/cgal/libraries ./configure --with-cgal=/full/path/to/cgal/libraries
