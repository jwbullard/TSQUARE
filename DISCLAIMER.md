## INTENT AND USE

The computer program described in this guide constitutes a prototype
model for performing spherical harmonic analysis of 3D star-shaped objects,
and for characterizing the computational and differential geometric properties
of those objects. It has been developed from the best knowledge and
understanding currently available, but has some limitations that must be
understood and considered by the user. TSQUARE is intended for use by persons
competent in the field of particle shape metrology and have some familiarity
with computers.
